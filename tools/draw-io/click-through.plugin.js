// Lets a click on the empty inside of a shape or a text box without fill reach the cell behind it,
// in the draw.io editor.
//
// draw.io selects a vertex on a click anywhere inside its bounds, also where it has no fill, so
// a text box larger than its text hides the shape behind it from the mouse.  The style key
// pointerEvents=0 turns that off for a shape whose fill is none: its border, and the text of its
// label, still select it.  This plugin gives every vertex whose fill is none that value, unless
// its own style sets pointerEvents, so the files stay as they are and every page behaves alike.
// The build reads no pointer events, so the slides do not change.
//
// The VS Code extension hediet.vscode-drawio loads the plugin from its setting
// "hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins", and asks once whether to allow it, and again after the file
// changes.
