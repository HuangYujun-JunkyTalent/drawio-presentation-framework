// Keeps the page view of the draw.io editor at one page for a slide, whatever the content
// reaches past the page.
//
// The editor draws as many copies of the page as cover the content, so a label or a shape that
// reaches past the edge of a slide adds a page beside it.  The build cuts every slide at the edge
// of its page, so content past the edge is hidden from the slide, and the extra page only gets
// in the way.  This plugin gives the graph a page layout of the one page at the origin when the
// page view is on and the page has the size of a slide of slide-format.drawio.xml, 1920 by 1080.
// Content past the edge stays on the grey canvas, where it can still be selected and edited.
// Every other page keeps the layout of the editor.
//
// The VS Code extension hediet.vscode-drawio loads the plugin from its setting
// "hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins", and asks once whether to allow it, and again after the file
// changes.
